# how to install this shader
Here are the steps to install this shader.

1) download and install the enchanced classicube shader at:https://github.com/williamlegotyler/enchanced-classicube-shader

2) download reshade at(normal version):https://reshade.me/

3) install reshade onto your classicube.exe file path(select all the effects).

4) launch the classicube application,go on a single player world.

5) when you joined you will see "compiling effects",wait for the effects to compile and then press the "home" key on your keyboard(if you dont have the home key use the windows on-screen keyboard).

6) when you see the tutorials skip everything by clicking "continue"

7) on the search bar search "motionblur",then you need to enable the cshade motionblur effect and on the settings of the effect wich you can find under the effect selection set the "scale" value to 250.

8) again,on the search bar search "magicbloom",enable it and on the settings of the effect set the "bloom intensity" to 1550,then set the "bloom thresold" to 2.1.

9) for the last time on the search bar search "godrays" and select ppfx godrays,after that go ahead on the ppfx godrays settings and crank up the samples to 130.

10) exit the reshade menu by pressing the "home" key(if it doesn't close press it multiple times).

11) enjoy your shaders!
