# classicube-shaders-EXTENDED
This is an enhancement over my previous project called "enchanced classicube shader" wich was just a texture pack that tried to recreate the experience of a shader,but this project offers some actual shaders,heres what it will add:

-enhanced colors

-better skybox

-bloom

-motionblur

-godrays(can create a fake real time shadows too)

-raytracing(optional as it gives a huge performance drop)

# system requirements
