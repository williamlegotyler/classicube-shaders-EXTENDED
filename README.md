# classicube-shaders-EXTENDED
This is a majour improvement over my previous project called "enchanced classicube shader" wich was just a texture pack that tried to recreate the experience of a shader, but this project offers a repository of actual shaders that when mixed togheter make the experience look way better, heres what it will add:

-enhanced colors

-bloom

-motionblur

-godrays(can create a fake real time shadows too)

-raytracing(optional as it gives a huge performance drop)

# system requirements

os: Windows

ram: 4 gb

cpu: 3 ghz

vram: 1 gb(2 gb if you plan to enable raytracing)
